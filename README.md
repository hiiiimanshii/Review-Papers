## 1) AI-Powered Resume Screening System Using NLP

Description:

This review paper takes a closer look at how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** are transforming the hiring process. Traditionally, recruiters had to manually go through hundreds of resumes—a task that’s not only time-consuming but also prone to bias. With AI and NLP, this process becomes much smarter. The system can read and understand resumes, pick out key details like skills, education, and work experience, and then automatically shortlist the best candidates. It’s like giving the hiring team a superpower to make faster and fairer decisions.

Key Technologies:

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Named Entity Recognition (NER)
* Machine Learning models (like SVM and Logistic Regression)
* Resume parsing and ranking tools

Why It Matters:

* Makes hiring quicker and more efficient
* Reduces human bias in candidate selection
* Increases accuracy in matching the right people to the right jobs
* Brings smart automation into HR processes



## 2) How AI Can Mitigate Vulnerabilities in IoT Ecosystems

Description:

The Internet of Things (IoT) connects billions of devices around the world—but with this connectivity comes serious security risks. This review paper explores how **AI can help protect these smart devices** from threats like hacking, malware, and data breaches. It looks at how AI-powered systems can detect unusual behavior, spot intrusions, and respond to threats in real-time. By using machine learning and advanced algorithms, AI helps create a safer, more secure IoT environment for industries and users alike.

Key Technologies:

* AI-powered Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
* Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning
* Edge AI for faster local decisions
* Reinforcement Learning for smarter responses

Why It Matters:

* Strengthens the security of connected devices
* Enables faster detection of cyber-attacks
* Helps build a more resilient IoT ecosystem
* Supports the safe growth of Industry 4.0



## 3) Multi-Language Code Comment Generation Using CodeBERT and NLP Techniques

Description:

Writing clear comments in code is crucial—but let’s face it, it can be tedious and time-consuming. This review paper dives into how **CodeBERT**, an advanced AI model trained on programming languages, can automatically generate helpful comments for code written in Python, Java, C++, and more. It explores how combining **deep learning** with **NLP** helps the system understand the purpose of the code and explain it in plain language. This not only saves time for developers but also makes codebases easier to read, maintain, and collaborate on.

Key Technologies:

* CodeBERT (pretrained transformer model)
* NLP-based summarization
* Sequence-to-sequence modeling
* Code structure analysis and tokenization

Why It Matters:

* Automates the task of writing code comments
* Makes code easier to understand for others
* Speeds up onboarding for new developers
* Enhances collaboration, especially in open-source projects
